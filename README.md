# Composebook ðŸª„

This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform project** targeting Android, iOS, Web.

[Jetpack Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/lp/compose-multiplatform/) let us share compose components between mutliples targets such as Android, iOS, Desktop, etc... The new target WASM allow us to now share our component to the web!

**Composebook** is a proof of concept that show how you can use jetpack compose multiplatform to create a **shared component library** for **Android and iOS** while letting you share this library to our beloved designers, collegues etc with **just a [link](https://composebook.vercel.app/)**. 
Removing the need to install an app to see those components! A bit like **a storybook for native app** ðŸ™Œ
